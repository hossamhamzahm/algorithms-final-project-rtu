Time Complexity:
let the dimension of the maze be n 
let the total number of nodes is n*n be N:

Each cell has at most four neighbor cells
let total number of edges E = 4*N
Time Complexity of Dijkstra after optimization: O((E+N) * log(N)) = O(N*Log(N))



Space Complexity:
let the dimension of the maze be n 
let the total number of nodes is n*n be N:
since we need additional array coins_val, space complexity of the algorithm is: O(N)
